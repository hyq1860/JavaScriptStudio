        //Creating closures in loops: A common mistake
        /*
        The helpText array defines three helpful hints, each associated with the ID of an input field in the document. 
        The loop cycles through these definitions, hooking up an onfocus event to each one that shows the associated help method.

        If you try this code out, you'll see that it doesn't work as expected. 
        No matter what field you focus on, the message about your age will be displayed.

        The reason for this is that the functions assigned to onfocus are closures; 
        they consist of the function definition and the captured environment from the setupHelp function's scope. ' +
        Three closures have been created,
        but each one shares the same single environment. 
        By the time the onfocus callbacks are executed, 
        the loop has run its course and the item variable (shared by all three closures) has been left pointing to the last entry in the helpText list.
